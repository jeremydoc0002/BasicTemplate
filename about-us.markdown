### MISSION STATEMENT

Indivisible NKY District 4 is a group of local progressive grassroots activists working to build a better Kentucky by holding our elected officials accountable. We will resist all political administrations and agendas which do not support and enact policies of inclusion, equality, justice, transparency, and honesty in government.

The primary goal of INKYD4 is to be a progressive voice of the people of Northern Kentucky.  It is our mission to scrutinize the actions of our political representatives at all levels of government and publicize the impact of those actions to the people in our communities. We strive to hold our representatives accountable when they choose their party, their donors, or their ideologies over their own constituentsâ€™ needs. Our overall goal is to move Kentucky forward both socially and politically and ensure that all constituents are represented fairly, that ALL sides are heard. We are working to effectively mobilize the vote in like-minded citizens in upcoming elections knowing that true change will come with a change in representation. Individually, the concerns of many constituents of the 4th district are being ignored. **United, our voice is strong....Indivisible we stand.**


### WHAT WE DO:

**Indivisible NKY District 4** monitors activities of our Members of Congress - Rep. Thomas Massie, Sen. Mitch McConnell, and Sen. Rand Paul - and how they respond to the Trump agenda. When our Members of Congress (MoCs) act in a manner that is in opposition to our core beliefs, we ensure they are made aware of our dissatisfaction. We visit their local offices, we call their staff, we send emails, we mail postcards, we demand town meetings, we organize rallies, and we march. In all these ways, we make sure they hear us, and we remind them they are supposed to serve for the benefit of their constituents. 

We adhere to the principles of coordination, focus, and persistence outlined in the political action manual called: **Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda.** Since its publication in December 2016, over 7,500 local Indivisible groups, at least two in every Congressional district in the country, are putting its advice into action. 

The advice and principles of the Indivisible Guide have been applied for use on state and local levels. Therefore, we also apply this knowledge and action for use in resisting the Bevin administration and the elected officials of the Kentucky state legislature within Congressional District 4.

### WHAT WE SUPPORT:

* The passage and implementation of laws, policies, and practices that recognize access to health care as a basic human right, including universal health coverage.

* The continuation of social services for people in poverty and paid family leave.

* Civil rights that ensure equality for all people regardless of race, ethnicity, citizenship, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, economic status, age, or cultural identity.
