### Mission Statement

Indivisible NKY District 4 is a group of local progressive grassroots activists working to build a better Kentucky by holding our elected officials accountable. We will resist all political administrations and agendas which do not support and enact policies of inclusion, equality, justice, transparency, and honesty in government.

The primary goal of INKYD4 is to be a progressive voice of the people of Northern Kentucky.  It is our mission to scrutinize the actions of our political representatives at all levels of government and publicize the impact of those actions to the people in our communities. We strive to hold our representatives accountable when they choose their party, their donors, or their ideologies over their own constituents’ needs. Our overall goal is to move Kentucky forward both socially and politically and ensure that all constituents are represented fairly, that ALL sides are heard. We are working to effectively mobilize the vote in like-minded citizens in upcoming elections knowing that true change will come with a change in representation. **Individually, the concerns of many constituents of the 4th district are being ignored. United, our voice is strong....Indivisible we stand.**

**We are locally focused and practice congressional advocacy to protect our values through:**

* **Town halls**. MoCs regularly hold public in-district events to show that they are listening to constituents. Our goal is to make them listen to us, and report out when they don’t.

* **District office visits.** Every MoC has one or several district offices. We go there to ask for meetings with MoCs and report out if they refuse to listen.

* **Coordinated calls**. Calls are a light lift, but can have an impact. We organize our group to barrage MoCs with calls at an opportune moment about and on a specific issue.

* **Marches and Rallies**. Public events to make our concerns known to our MoCs

**Sounds good to me, how can I participate?**
