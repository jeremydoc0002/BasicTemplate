### Who We Are

We are a grassroots organization that is an organically-formed and locally-led group. We work together to support mutual respect, tolerance, and kindness; to hold Congress accountable and advocate for political, social, and economic equality. We believe that our government has a responsibility to promote the rights and welfare of all citizens, regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation and that government should make laws that are good for everyone. **We stand Indivisible**.
**We support**

* Freedom of speech and of the press

* Economic opportunity for everyone

* A rational defense policy

* Affordable health care for all

* Religious liberty for all

* Responsible stewardship of our planet

* Common sense tax reform that does not favor the wealthy

**We reject**

* Racism, authoritarianism, and corruption

* MoCs (members of Congress) who ignore reality and make up their own facts

* Scare tactics and slander

**We are locally focused and practice congressional advocacy to protect our values through:**

* **Town halls**. MoCs regularly hold public in-district events to show that they are listening to constituents. Our goal is to make them listen to us, and report out when they donâ€™t.

* **District office visits.** Every MoC has one or several district offices. We go there to ask for meetings with MoCs and report out if they refuse to listen.

* **Coordinated calls**. Calls are a light lift, but can have an impact. We organize our group to barrage MoCs with calls at an opportune moment about and on a specific issue.

* **Marches and Rallies**. Public events to make our concerns known to our MoCs

**Sounds good to me, how can I participate?**

There are many opportunities for you to put your skills to use with Indivisible NKY-District 4. Be sure to visit our Facebook page and Website to learn more and join us for one of our regular monthly chapter meetings.

* Media Action Team: ex. Writing blog posts and editorials.

* Outreach Action Team: ex. Arranging canvassing and voter registration events.
