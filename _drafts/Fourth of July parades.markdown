Why We Must Stop Kavanaugh From Becoming Trump’s Next Supreme Court Justice
[](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/must-stop-kavanaugh-becoming-trumps-next-supreme-court-justice/)

It’s happened: Trump has announced his nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. On July 9th, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and set the stage for a monumental shift in the Court’s makeup. If Trump is successful at getting Kavanaugh confirmed, the Court will work to preserve the Trump agenda for decades to come.

Key issues that affect us all hang in the balance, including reproductive rights, access to health care, LGBTQ rights, environmental protections, and much more. Further, the next Supreme Court justice could rule on cases involving Trump himself, whether resulting from the Mueller investigation or otherwise.

PROTECTING THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL INSTEAD OF ALL OF US

A Supreme Court with five far-right extreme justices will side with the wealthy and powerful, instead of protecting the rights of workers, consumers, and all Americans.

CORE PROTECTIONS TO THE ENVIRONMENT ARE IN DANGER

An extreme right-wing Court will be hostile to environmental protections, placing EPA regulations and efforts to curb climate change in peril.

HOLDING TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE

Kavanaugh was a key author of the infamous Starr report during the Clinton administration, and has expressed numerous opinions about the role of a Special Counsel (such as Robert Mueller). He does not believe that a sitting president can be indicted, and believes presidents should have wide latitude to hire and fire special counsels. This does not bode well for the Mueller investigation.

SO, WHAT CAN YOU DO?
1.  Call Mitch McConnell's office and demand that the confirmation hearing is after the Midterm elections....just like he did when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland.
Sample script (from Flip KY):
My name is XXX and my address and zip code is XXX. I demand that you wait to consider any Supreme Court nominee until after the November elections. If confirmation hearings are held earlier I expect you to vote against any nominee. No judicial confirmation should be made in an election year before the election. I also demand that you vote no on any nominee who is hand picked by the Federalist society and is willing to overturn settled law.

2.  Call Rand Paul's office.  Rand can be a wild card sometimes if something bothers him.  Brett Kavanaugh's stance that a sitting president should be shielded from criminal and civil action goes against the constitution's system of checks and balances.  This angle might be able to sway Rand.  
***Sample script (from Flip KY)
Hi, my name is [NAME], and I'm a constituent from [CITY]. I'm calling to demand Senator XXX oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s history of advocating for positions that are outside of mainstream beliefs are deeply troubling. His position that a sitting president should be shielded from criminal and civil action makes clear that Trump is attempting to subvert checks and balances to avoid accountability for his actions. Thank you.
