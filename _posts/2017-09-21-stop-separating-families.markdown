The Trump administration has accelerated deportations in the last several weeks. Thousands of children have been torn away from their families and warehoused in detention centers.

Join us for a coordinated national day of action to call for an end to the Trump administration’s family separation policy and for an end of ICE’S terror in our communities.

No human being is illegal! Ningun ser humano es ilegal!
