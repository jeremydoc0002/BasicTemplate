We are hosting a booth at the annual AFL-CIO hosted picnic at Coney Island. Local unions from the tri-state area will be in attendance and we want to be there to show our support and to let them know more about our organization. Use the link to the Facebook invite to learn more about event and how you can sign up to staff the booth.
