May 1st is May Day, a day for workers throughout the world. It commemorates the 1886 national strike for the eight-hour work day in the United States.* If you work for wages, this is your day! 

We are the vast majority, the 99%, and we will rally in solidarity with one another, across artificial boundaries meant to keep us divided and weak. Our common cause is a demand for justice, equity, and a humane and rational sharing of the fruits of labor. Our nation is far from "broke," poverty is not inevitable, and workers need not agree to compete against each other for crumbs from an abundant table set for billionaires and millionaires in the richest country in the world. 

United and empowered we can fight against multiple assaults on workers' dignity and livelihoods, such as:

"Right to Work" legislation, which confers no rights, hinders the ability of workers to act collectively, and results in lower wages and less safe workplaces;

Scapegoating of immigrants, which keeps them fearful and less likely to exercise their rights as workers: undocumented immigrants are the group of workers most likely to have wages stolen and to be injured on the job;

Declining wages since the 1970s in a race to the bottom with a globalized workforce, keeping workers scrambling for mere survival and our economy stagnating;

The campaign to cripple our public education system through privatization, union-busting, and arbitrary performance-based testing for our teachers, which is an injustice to working people today and future generations who deserve a quality public education system;

Mass incarceration, featuring "school to prison pipelines," a failed drug war fought largely in our underfunded cities, and policies that deny benefits or even employment to convicts, which exacerbate the problems of poverty;

Discrimination -- whether for race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, religion, age, or sexual orientation -- keeping us divided and weak.

On May 1st let's join a tradition of struggle for immigrants' and workers' rights by committing to fight for the interests of the vast majority of working people over the profits of the few.

Fight for $15!
Build schools, not walls!
Equal rights for all!
No one is illegal!
