Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an American immigration policy established by the Obama administration in June 2012. DACA allows certain illegal immigrants who entered the country as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility for a work permit. 

Approximately 800,000 such young people (referred to as "Dreamers" after the DREAM Act) were enrolled in the program as of 2017. Approximately 6,000 of these young immigrants reside in Kentucky, the majority in Louisville.
According to a recent report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the state of Kentucky could lose millions in tax revenue if these Dreamers are forced to leave their homes and jobs. On that basis alone, we should oppose the president’s proposal to eliminate the DACA program. However, economic reasons aside, this decision is just plain wrong and immoral. We should not punish children who had no say in the decision to come to this country. They are productive citizens, who have been comprehensively vetted, and who do not “take” goods and services away from US citizens.

Attorney Generals from 15 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to stop the administration from winding down the DACA program.

Please contact Attorney General Andy Beshear and urge him to join his colleagues in this effort.
