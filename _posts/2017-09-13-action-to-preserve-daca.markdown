On July 1st, the Bevin Administration eliminated dental, vision, and non-emergency medical transportation benefits for Medicaid expansion members without notice. This was a voluntary decision made by the Bevin Administration following a court ruling on June 29th that blocked implementation of Kentucky HEALTH (Governor Bevin's Medicaid changes). 
Since then, the Bevin Administration has posted public notice of a State Plan Amendment submitted to the Federal Government, asking for permission to remove these benefits. You can view the notice here:
