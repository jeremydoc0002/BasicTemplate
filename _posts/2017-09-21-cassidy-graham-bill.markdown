It is strange to be on the same side as Rand Paul, who will vote no on the Cassidy-Graham Healthcare Bill, albeit for all the wrong reasons. It is also strange that our other senator, Mitch McConnell, is a driving force behind this abomination of a healthcare bill and the general impetus to repeal the ACA. It makes calling them seem pointless. But our voices matter, even if they are not listened to. 

This bill is the worst one yet. Estimates of 32 million people losing their healthcare, rate increases, states removing protections against discriminating against pre-existing conditions and many other horrible outcomes are contained in this bill. Kentucky alone could lose up to 11 billion dollars in federal funds for healthcare. 

Once again, we must call our elected representatives and literally beg for our lives. We work for the day that we will not have to do this again. As noted, our calls might not have any effect on our particular senators, but simply being able to point to the fact that we did call, that we were not silent, can have an effect in the bigger picture. Weâ€™re sick of calling, they are sick of hearing from us. If they want us to stop calling, maybe they should stop trying to take our healthcare away.

Use the contact information on the left to encourage Senator Paul to stick with his no vote this time and to let Senator McConnell know that you are opposed to his support of this bill.
