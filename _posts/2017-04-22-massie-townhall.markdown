[Example Link](http://example.com) Today's Daily Action is to call Congressman Massie and demand he hold a Town Hall.

Congressman Massie is refusing to meet his congressional obligation to meet with his constituents. He has met with his donors but not the voters. This is unacceptable! Our voices deserve to heard and our positions represented.
