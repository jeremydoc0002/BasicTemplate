Rep. Thomas Massie is scheduled to speak inside of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Building at a Republican Party paid event. Congressman Massie has repeatedly denied his constituents' phone calls, emails, and faxes requesting a public Town Hall event to discuss the issues, so we are bringing the event to him! Anyone who believes it is our right to be heard and Congressman Massie's duty to listen is invited. Bring your signs, Mega Phones, and Cell Phones.

Tri-state Free Thinkers will be with us, and their President, Jim Helton will be speaking.
