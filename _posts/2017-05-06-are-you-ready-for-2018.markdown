Here is a look at 2016 election data for KY District 4. The intent is to begin to drill down on specific big picture approaches and strategies for 2018 and beyond.

# District 4 House Votes vs. Registrations

In the chart above, you're seeing the total number of votes in KY District 4's House of Representatives race versus the total number of registered voters in each county of KY District 4, split by county.

Notable here is the obvious: in NKY's 4 big counties, despite the fact that larger swaths of voters failed to appear at the polls, these counties still produced large numbers of voters relative to smaller areas of the district.  As we step through, we'll break these segments down a bit further.

This chart shows registration by party in each District 4 county.  I found it surprising that there are more Democratic registrations in many of the smaller counties than there are Republican registrations.

This chart shows the voting breakdown in the 2016 District 4 House race. No surprises here.

This is the same chart with a comparison against all registered voters added. Notable here is the lack of Democratic turnout we see. In Bracken County, for example, Sidle only managed 775 votes.
