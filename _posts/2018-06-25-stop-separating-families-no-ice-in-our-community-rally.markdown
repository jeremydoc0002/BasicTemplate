The Trump administration has accelerated deportations in the last several weeks. Thousands of children have been torn away from their families and warehoused in detention centers.\
\
Join us for a coordinated national day of action to call for an end to the Trump administration's family separation policy and for an end of ICE'S terror in our communities.\
