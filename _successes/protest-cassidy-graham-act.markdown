September 21st, Ft. Wright. Dressed in black and holding tombstones, INKYD4 members meet outside Senator Mitch McConnell's Ft. Wright office to protest the Cassidy-Graham Act. Their signs and presence were designed to draw attention to the millions of Americans who lives are endangered by this bill.
