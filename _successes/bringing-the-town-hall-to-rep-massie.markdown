Rep. Thomas Massie was scheduled to speak inside of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Building at a Republican Party paid event. Congressman Massie has repeatedly denied his constituents' phone calls, emails, and faxes requesting a public Town Hall event to discuss the issues, so we decided to bring the event to him. Massie arrived at his speaking event 1 hour early to avoid those who showed up to demand he have a Town hall and speak with all his constituents. We recorded the speakers and we appreciate their courage to speak.

Thank you to Jim Helton from Tri-state Free Thinkers, Sharon Fleck from Indivisible Shelbyville, Abigail Kessinger from Indivisible NKY District 4, and Laura Adams from Indivisible Henry County, for speaking at our Bringing the Town Hall to Rep. Massie Protest.
