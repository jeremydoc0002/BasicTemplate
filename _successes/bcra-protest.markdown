On Monday, June 26th, Indivisible NKY District 4 partnered with NKY Unites, Tri-State Freethinkers, NKY Chapter of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio to organize a rally in  outside of Senator Mitch McConnell's office in Ft. Wright in protest of the Better Care Reconciliation Act. This bill threatened the healthcare of millions of Americans. Thanks to overwhelming resistance to the provisions of this bill across the country, including protests like this one, the bill failed.
